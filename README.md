# G510s
Graphical utility for Logitech G510 and G510s keyboards on Linux.

Requires LibG15 found here: https://github.com/vividnightmare/libg15  
You may use a different version of libg15, but it will have some issues with these keyboards.  
I would send the fixes upstream, but upstream doesn't appear to exist anymore.

There is an Ubuntu PPA available here: https://launchpad.net/~vivnet/+archive/ubuntu/g510s
