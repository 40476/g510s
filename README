ABOUT:

G510s is a simple utility designed to enable the full
features of the Logitech G510 and G510s keyboards
under Linux.  It is written entirely in C.

It is based on g15tools, g15daemon, and gnome15.

g15tools: http://sourceforge.net/projects/g15tools/
g15daemon: http://sourceforge.net/projects/g15daemon/

Note that there is no official source for gnome15 as 
of mid-2015.

Additionally, libg15 within the official g15tools repository
is insufficient for the operation of these keyboards and 
needs additional, yet minor, changes.  I will include
a patched, unofficial version of libg15 in the G510s source
repository.  The upstream repository appears unmaintained
but I will attempt to get these changes merged in the future.


WHY:

Existing implementations for this keyboard on Linux have a 
number of show stopping bugs.  Because g15daemon appears 
unmaintained and gnome15 has practically vanished overnight,
I have decided to write a new implementation based on the
existing g15daemon.  G510s solves the following problems
associated with g15daemon and gnome15:

  - The keyboard stops responding
  - Sometimes pressing an extra key twice is required
  - The LCD display requires a button press to update


FEATURES:

  - Libg15 and Libusb debugging via cli switch
  - Four profiles, selectable with M1, M2, M3 and MR keys
  - Custom LED backlight colors per profile
  - Custom G-Key script/command execution per profile
  - Persistent sessions
  - Executable as user (instead of root)
  - GUI and AppIndicator for desktop integration
  - Handles device hotplug events (on-device audio)
  - LCD display server
  - libg15daemon-client compatibility

USAGE:

  DO NOT RUN AS ROOT

  After install you will need to reboot or reload udev
    sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart

  G510s should start automatically when you log in.
  You can manually start it with

  ./g510s or /usr/local/bin/g510s

  Additional runtime options are available, see

  g510s --help

  G510s relies on the HOME environment variable for session
  saves.  If is not set the program should work, but you
  won't have session persistent colors or G-Key commands.

  To check if it is set, run:

  echo $HOME

  You can set it in a number of ways, including:

  HOME=<path> ./g510s
