# g510s
Graphical utility for Logitech G510 and G510s keyboards on Linux.

Requires LibG15 found here: https://github.com/vividnightmare/libg15

There is an Ubuntu PPA available here: https://launchpad.net/~vivnet/+archive/ubuntu/g510s
It currently has packages published for Wily (15.10, EOL), Xenial (16.04), Zesty (17.04, EOL), and Bionic (18.04).
If you would like me to add packages for a different release, open an issue and let me know which one, I would be happy to publish packages for any currently supported Ubuntu release.
